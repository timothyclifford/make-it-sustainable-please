# Make it sustainable please

Startups are built for growth.

They optimise for increasing user numbers and profitiability.

This approach completely ignores ethical and sustainable factors. As history has proven, concentrating on these two metrics alone tends be a race to the bottom where other, typically negative impacts are missed or even ignored. Examples of this are the ever growing effects social media can have on health, the explosion of rental prices caused by Airbnb or the explosion of travelling lifestyle bloggers on Instagram.
